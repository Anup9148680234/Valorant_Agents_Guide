    <p>Brimstone is a heavy support agent and requires time and effort to master. 
        Your main objective as Brimstone is to cut off rotations and clear sites, 
        which can bring the advantage to your team. Brimstone has four special abilities: Stim Beacon, 
        Incendiary, Sky Smoke, and Orbital Strike.
        Brimstone's role as a controller is to set up his team for success. 
        So you want to play around your team as much as possible. You don't have to play a very defensive style or 
        a very aggressive one. Finding a balance between when to be more aggressive or to play more defensive is key for a controller. 
        The major strength of Brimstone is his ability to deny vision to the enemy team. So you always want to 
        smoke crucial parts of a bombsite when your team is going to execute towards there. That way it becomes 
        easier for your team to enter and your enemies will have to expose themselves if they want to stop the push.
