    <p>Reyna takes what she wants when she wants it, no matter who is standing in her way. Savage and almost animalistic, she is not one to hesitate when it comes to eliminating her enemies and getting blood on her hands. She has a strong dislike for technology and thrives on the enemy's misery, and loves to compete with fellow Radiants to see who is the most powerful.

        She seems to have a cynical view towards the rest of the world due to the pain that she has experienced in order to survive. However, she acknowledges that her Earth is still her home, and she resolves to defend it even if it means spilling more blood</p>
